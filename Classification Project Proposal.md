# Classification Project Proposal
##### Question/Need

The aim is to identify a specific region as an accident hot spot based on the number of fatalities and other features identified. Accident hotspots can be streamlined for expedited analysis of cause of crashes and subsequent treatment to address those, such as to improve visibility, reduce speed etc.  

##### Data 

The data is the 2016 NHTSA traffic fatalities data. 
There are 86,474 rows in the data. The following are the possible features for the model: 
- number of motor vehicles striking non-motorist
- time/day/month of crash
- land use (urban, rural etc)
- functional category of road (arterial etc.)
- manner of collision
- age, gender of victim
- injury severity
- seating position
- helmet
- airbag
- ejection
- alcohol involvement
- drug test results
- time of death
- race of the victim

##### Tools
The following tools will be used: 
SQL for loading data and initial queries;
Pandas for data cleaning & EDA, logistic regression/Bayesian model; visualization using Tableau, Bokeh, or Plotly.
